# Lomatium sampling oddities

Going through metadata and datasheets to find broad-scale (i.e., not individual plant/record) notes about sampling irregularities that should be accounted for in analysis.

### 2017

Plot 13: ran out of pins when tagging plants, so new plants (?) were missed. Note says "1-3 on the 0-9 side, many more on the 10-19 side".

Seems to me like this means don't include this plot in recruitment in 2017.

Also this note fro metadata: "We tagged a lot of new plants in 2017, but probably not seedlings. Seems likely we missed some of these in 2016 OR that plants commonly go dormant." So maybe assume all new plant data in 2017 is suspect?

### 2019 

Seems from metadata like demo was not done in plot 9 this year (note says "diversity only"). N.b. this note was found in one of the 2020 metadata files ("v4").

(Actually I went and checked and it does look like demo happened in plot 9 in 2019... so... idk what this note is saying.)

### 2020 

Here are notes from metadata:

Plot 1: \*eaten leaves were included in counts, 0-9, found 2 NPNT from last year!
Plot 2: 0-9, added some new plants
Plot 3: all in 0-6, no new plants found
Plot 4: all; measured individual in div plot, tagged more in 1st plot but not in div plot
Plot 5: none flowering, measured no large ones in 2nd plot
Plot 6: measured all + new plants
Plot 7: measured all + new plants
Plot 8:  none
Plot 9: all
Plot 10: all
Plot 11: none
Plot 12: all + new plants
Plot 13: 0-9 + new plants
Plot 14: 0-9, measured all the flowering plants in 2nd plot as well
Plot 15: 0-9, looked for new seedlings but found none; sporadically looked in 2nd plot for big ones

Takeaways here:
- Most plots were not surveyed for xcoord > 9
- Recruitment was suspect
- Some plots skipped altogether

Resurveying old plants:
Plots 1, 2, 13, 14, 15: only surveyed 0-9
Plot 3: only surveyed 0-6
Plots 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12: surveyed all plants
Plots 8, 11: no surveys (these might be the empty plots anyway)
Plot 5: unclear

Surveying new plants:
Plots 2, 13, 15: only surveyed 0-9
Plot 3: ony surveyed 0-6
Plots 4(?), 6, 7, 12: surveyed all plants
Plots 8, 11: no surveys (might be empty anyway)
Plot 1, 5, 9, 10: unclear
